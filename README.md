This program may be used for any purpose other than violating the law.
We are not responsible for any damage caused by this program.
This program obtains the student ID number from the student ID card and sends an email to the student email associated with the student ID number.
Basically, this program is compatible with any student ID card that stores the student ID number in plain text using FeliCa, so please adjust it according to the system code of the school you belong to.
The code shown in the comment out is the most common student ID number stored in FeliCa, so you can try it out with that code.
